# Game_Engine_Updates_2
Part 2 of my graphics engine updates.
Repo for updating and showcasing new features in my graphics engine. Source code remains private. This project is mainly for education purposes. Any graphics engine names are just place holders.

UPDATE_05:
  - Began implementing the file explorer functionality.
    - Most of the basic functionality exist, but QOL and bugs need smoothing out.
  - TODO NEXT:
    - implement more features and improve the file explorer functionality.
